# Agents shar packaging

This repo will build a shar script which is a self contained script that includes
SDC agents (by default all of them in agents.json) and a small script to unpack
this directory and run the install.sh script within.  This so called "agentsshar"
is used to install and upgrade agents in SDC.

See the Makefile for typical build targets.

The main 'mk-agents-shar' script presumes a MG-style directory structure
(https://mo.joyent.com/docs/mg/master/#bits-directory-structure).
