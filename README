**WARNING**: This branch is not used. The 'release-20110901-upgrade'
agents shar (aka 'agentsshar-upgrade') is built out of the *master*
branch of this repo. Sue me. --Trent



Note for this branch (release-20110901-upgrade): We are attempting
to use this repo to build a shar for the "agents-upgrade", i.e. the
6.5 agents for 6.5 CNs during a transition to SDC7.

Between 6.5 and 7 the building of the source agent packages that
go in the shar has changed: They are build separately and are
uploaded to bits.joyent.us in a dir structure defined by MG
(moutain-gorilla.git). That means a slightly different layout
such that we abuse the arguments to `mk-agents-shar` a little
bit.

The main build target here is:

    make upgradeshar

However note that the MG-managed version of this build (see
the MG "agentsshar-upgrade" target) uses `mk-agents-shar`
directly and slightly differently.

What this does
==============

This creates a shar script which is a self contained script that includes
everything from the agents directory and a small script to unpack this directory
and run the install.sh script within.

The resulting agents-<buildstamp>.sh script can then be run on a GZ that needs
the provisioner run (could also be sent through ur-agent).
