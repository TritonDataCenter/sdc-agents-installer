Building the agents-<buildstamp>.sh script
==========================================

NOTE: This must be run on a 147 build machine such as bh1-build or bh1-autobuild.
For details on how to setup such an environment see here:

 https://hub.joyent.com/wiki/display/dev/joyent_147

# build the atropos.tgz and provisioner.tgz files (using: CC=gcc gmake all npm)
* copy the atropos.tgz and provisioner.tgz files into the agents/ directory
* run ./build_scripts from this directory


What this does
==============

This creates a shar script which is a self contained script that includes
everything from the agents directory and a small script to unpack this directory
and run the install.sh script within.

The resulting agents-<buildstamp>.sh script can then be run on a GZ that needs
the provisioner run (could also be sent through ur-agent).
